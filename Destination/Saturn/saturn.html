        <h2>Mars Tourism Requirements</h2><br />
        <section class="additional-info">
            <h3>Mars Entry Requirements:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Must be in good physical and mental health. The journey to Mars is long and challenging, and
                    tourists must be able to withstand the rigors of space travel.</li>
                <li>Must have a valid passport and visa. Tourists will need to obtain a visa from the Martian government
                    before they can travel to Mars.</li>
                <li>Must have a high level of education. Tourists will need to have a good understanding of science and
                    engineering in order to survive on Mars.</li>
                <li>Must be able to speak English. English is the lingua franca of space travel, so tourists will need
                    to be able to communicate with the crew and other tourists.</li>
                <li>Must be willing to undergo rigorous training. Tourists will need to undergo extensive training in
                    order to prepare for the journey to Mars. This training will cover topics such as space travel,
                    survival skills, and Martian geology.</li>
                <li>Must be able to pay the high cost of travel to Mars. The cost of travel to Mars is still very high,
                    so tourists will need to be wealthy enough to afford it.</li>
                <li>These are just some of the imaginary Mars entry requirements for tourists. The actual requirements
                    may vary depending on the specific company or organization that is offering Mars tourism packages.
                </li>
            </ul>


            <h3>Additional Considerations:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The age of the tourist. Younger tourists may be more adaptable to the harsh Martian environment, but
                    they may also be more prone to risk-taking.</li>
                <li>The tourist's experience with space travel. Tourists who have previous experience with space travel
                    may be better prepared for the journey to Mars.</li>
                <li>The tourist's physical and mental health. Tourists who have any underlying health conditions may be
                    at a higher risk of complications during the journey to Mars.</li>
                <li>The tourist's financial resources. The cost of travel to Mars is still very high, so tourists will
                    need to be wealthy enough to afford it.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to allow tourists to travel to Mars
                will be up to the Martian government. The government will need to weigh the risks and benefits of
                tourism before making a decision.</p>

        <h2>Travel Tips</h2><br />
        <p>Be prepared for the harsh environment:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><u>Be prepared for the harsh environment.</u> Mars is a cold, dry, and dusty place with a thin
                atmosphere. The average temperature on Mars is -63 degrees Celsius, and the atmosphere is only about
                0.03% as dense as Earth's atmosphere. This means that there is no oxygen to breathe, and the radiation
                levels are much higher than on Earth.</li>
            <li><u>Wear protective clothing.</u> You will need to wear protective clothing to protect yourself from the
                harsh Martian environment. This includes a spacesuit, helmet, gloves, and boots.</li>
            <li><u> careful where you step.</u> The Martian surface is covered in rocks and dust, and there are many
                hazards, such as crevasses and sinkholes.</li>
            <li><u>Stay in contact with your crew.</u> It is important to stay in contact with your crew at all times.
                This is especially important in case of an emergency.</li>
            <li><u> patient and respectful.</u> Mars is a new and exciting place, but it is also a fragile environment.
                It is important to be patient and respectful of the Martian environment.</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="additional-tips">
        <h2>Additional Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><u>Get plenty of rest.</u> The journey to Mars is long and tiring, so it is important to get plenty of
                rest before and after your trip.</li>
            <li><u>Stay hydrated.</u> The Martian atmosphere is very dry, so it is important to stay hydrated. Drink
                plenty of water and avoid alcohol and caffeine.</li>
            <li><u>Exercise regularly.</u> The journey to Mars is sedentary, so it is important to exercise regularly to
                stay in shape.</li>
            <li><u>Take care of your mental health.</u> The journey to Mars can be stressful, so it is important to take
                care of your mental health. Talk to a therapist or counselor if you are feeling stressed or anxious.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Following these tips will help you to have a safe and enjoyable Mars tourism experience.</p>
